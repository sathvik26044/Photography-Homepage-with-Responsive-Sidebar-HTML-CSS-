# 📸 Photography Homepage Website

Welcome to my **Photography Homepage Website** project!
This is a simple and elegant single-page layout built using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

## 🌐 Features

* A **responsive menu toggle system** built using HTML checkboxes and CSS only — no JavaScript!
* Clean user interface with a **collapsible sidebar menu**.
* Menu appears when clicking on the ☰ (menu icon) and disappears when clicking the ❌ (X icon).
* Hover effects added for menu items and icons to enhance user experience and visual appeal.
* Social media icons slightly scale up on hover for better interactivity and emphasis.
* Smooth and minimal design optimized for photographers and creative portfolios.
* Icons and fonts used to enhance visual appeal.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**

## 🎨 Fonts and Icons

* **Font Icons:**

  * [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
  * [Google Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)

* **Font Styles:**

  * Fonts used from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for typography enhancement.

## 📷 Menu Structure

* Gallery
* Shortcuts
* Exhibits
* Events

## 📌 How It Works

The menu toggle is built using a hidden checkbox and label selectors in CSS. When the checkbox is checked, the menu content becomes visible. This avoids the need for JavaScript and maintains functionality with just HTML/CSS.
